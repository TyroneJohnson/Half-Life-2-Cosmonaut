## Overview

Have you ever wanted to play the Cosmonaut modification, which was originally developed for Half-Life 2: Half-Life 2: Episode Two by Dolmo, but 
in Garry's Mod with multiplayer support? Then you've exactly hit the nail on the head with this modification.


HL2: Cosmonaut aims to provide a seamless cooperative as well as singleplayer experience for the aformentioned campaign by Dolmo, by inter alias, utilizing the Lambda Co-Op framework.
